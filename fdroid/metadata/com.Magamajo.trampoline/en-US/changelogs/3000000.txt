## Note of the Author

I would like to say that this is in fact the first official release of a working that can be ran on Linux/Android.
The application has been released on under this repos:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilienNaveau/magamajo/master/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=BABC4B08FB8BA7C11E54FD317FF3F3D43FBF4891C64F0B2517523E53273B37BC

And this release contains the binaries I made for the WebGl, Linux and Android plateform.
All binaries come from this build:
https://github.com/MaximilienNaveau/trampoline/actions/runs/8860104954

The game WebGL version is deployed as a github page here https://maximiliennaveau.github.io/trampoline/

This project is a solo dev project which is made under my free time so of course there will be bugs and features are gonna be slow to be released.

I am rather new to DevOps so I will make mistakes. Please be nice if you are interested in this project.
